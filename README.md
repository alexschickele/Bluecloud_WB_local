**Description :**
This repository corresponds to the local development code for the Blue-Cloud2026 project - Ecosystem Workbench.
The latter aims to improve the availability, quality and interoperability of large collections of plankton observations based on traditional counts, quantitative imaging and genomic methods available from the EMODnet/EurOBIS and ELIXIR data infrastructures. It will develop a generic modelling workflow in Blue-Cloud 2026 to generate high-quality interpolated maps of the global distribution of these plankton entities. It will provide a sustainable workflow for production of ecosystem-level EOVs following clear QA/QC steps and according to best practices in habitat modelling.

Technical documentation will be provided in a later version
